Semantic Text Similarity
========================
OR Similarity between brands and affiliates


OLD IDEAS
=========
OR categorize bookmarks by similarweb category and secondary sort by page rank similarity of page contents & sell as a product
OR similarity between bookmarks scraped.  Sorted into a new bookmarks order (I have experience doing something similar)
OR drop your bookmarks file into the website, and it will auto sort your websites by classified category and page rank.  (Features: text on website, target: similarweb primary category)
Also outputs a bookmark file.
